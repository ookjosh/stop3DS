## Overview

Onion skinning is really important in creating animations and is fun. It derives from old hand animation techniques which used a transparent sheet to allow the animators to see the previous frame. On computers this is an alpha compositing problem.


### Progress
I have a working basic version that displays the previous frame if it exists. Depending on a) if it is necessary and b) if it works well with UX it might be cool to be able to mark an alternate frame as the onion skin.
