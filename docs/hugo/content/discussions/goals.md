There are many features that I want to implement into this application, both in order to make it usable for its intended purpose and to offer design challenges for me to face. The following is a nonexaustive (but fairly comprehensive) list of things that I think would be cool to include:

```
- Onion Skinning
- Large number of frames
- Framerate adjustment
- Export to file
- Load from file
- Video generator (external?)
- Palette and full color

- Actor/Sprite Support
- Basic splines?
- Smart animation
- Copy/paste frames and layers
- Animation Scrubbing (timeline guide?)
- Color flood
- Transparency
- Good stylus input
- Decent UX
- Frame compression
- Animation gallery
- Import from other project
- Good code structure
- Portable
- Web enabled (dedicated server)
- Scene Support? (Animation hierarchy)
- Undo/redo
```
.{{% /expand%}}

Information on each of these features is reflected in "Feature Tracking" which serves as a living documentation source on their development.
