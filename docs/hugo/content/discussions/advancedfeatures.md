## Overview
There are many features I would consider "advanced" in that they go beyond a simple frame-by-frame drawing and animation app. These features include things such as "sprite" support, assets that can be manipulated and treated as objects (moved, transformed) without having to manually redraw everything. More interestingly this can lead to "smart animation" or sprites that react inputs from the user such as a fish reacting to food as seen in Bret Victor's video "Stop drawing dead fish". Taking this drawing application and allowing it to go beyond human input in small ways like this is an interesting potential path.
